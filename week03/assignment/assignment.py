'''
Requirements
1. Write a multithreaded program that counts the number of prime numbers 
   between 100,000,000 and 100,770,803.
2. The program should be able to use a variable amount of threads.
3. Each thread should look over an approximately equal number of numbers.
   This means that you need to devise an algorithm that can divide up the
   770,803 numbers "fairly" based on a variable number of threads. 
4. The algorithm should work for 1 to 101 threads.
5. COMMENT every line that you write yourself.
   
Questions:
1. Time to run using 1 thread =
2. Time to run using 10 threads =
3. Time to run using 50 threads =
4. Time to run using 101 threads =
4. Based on your study of the GIL (see https://realpython.com/python-gil), 
   what conclusions can you draw about the similarity of the times (short answer)?
   >
   >
5. Is this assignment an IO Bound or CPU Bound problem (see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/868568/what-do-the-terms-cpu-bound-and-i-o-bound-mean)?
